# Vanilla Case List — Seasonal Themes

This is the **theme workshop** for the [Vanilla Case List](https://github.com/lublurrr/vanilla-test-list):
a full, working copy of the site with a seasonal theme layer on top, so new
looks can be built and tried out here without touching the live list.

Left to itself, the site now dresses for the time of year — pumpkins through
late October, holly through December, pastels around Easter — and a theme
button in the bottom-right corner lets anyone pick a different one.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Theme gallery** | [`themes.html`](themes.html) — every theme side by side |
| **Theme palettes** | [`themes.css`](themes.css) — one block of colour tokens per season |
| **Theme logic** | [`themes.js`](themes.js) — which theme, and when |
| **Scenes** | [`scenes.js`](scenes.js) — the illustrated horizon behind the masthead |

Two differences from the live repository, both deliberate:

- no `CNAME`, so this copy never competes for the `vanillacaselist.com`
  domain — it publishes to `lublurrr.github.io/vanilla-test-list-themes/`;
- no analytics tag, so staging traffic stays out of the live site's numbers.

Everything below the theme chapter is the list-maintainer documentation
carried over from the main repository; the case data here is a snapshot and is
not the one to edit for the live list.

## Seasonal themes

### How a theme gets chosen

`themes.js` sets `data-theme="…"` on `<html>`, and every rule in `themes.css`
hangs off that attribute. It resolves in this order, highest first:

1. **`?theme=<id>` in the URL** — a one-off preview, not remembered. Handy for
   sharing a look: `index.html?theme=christmas`.
2. **The visitor's saved choice** — whatever they last picked in the theme
   button, kept in `localStorage`. Choosing *Automatic* clears it.
3. **Today's date** — the windows in the `THEMES` table below.
4. **`classic`** — the courtroom cream the list has always worn.

The script is loaded from `<head>` *without* `defer` on purpose: it has to set
the attribute before the first paint, or the classic palette flashes on screen
on its way to the season.

### The seasons

| Theme | `id` | Window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classic Vanilla | `classic` | all year (the fallback) |
| New Year | `newyear` | Dec 28 – Jan 6 |
| Valentine's | `valentines` | Feb 7 – Feb 16 |
| Easter | `easter` | Mar 20 – Apr 21 |
| Summer | `summer` | Jun 15 – Aug 31 |
| Autumn | `autumn` | Sep 15 – Sep 30, Nov 3 – Nov 30 |
| Halloween | `halloween` | Oct 1 – Nov 2 |
| Christmas | `christmas` | Dec 1 – Dec 27 |

Easter moves around the calendar, so its window is a generous spring band
rather than an exact date. Where two windows overlap, the **tighter** one wins,
so a one-week holiday always beats a three-month season.

### Adding a season

Two edits, and nothing else in the site needs to know about it:

1. **`themes.css`** — add a `[data-theme="<id>"]` block. Copy an existing one
   and change the colours. Two house rules keep the site readable: the
   cream/paper family stays light, the ink family stays dark. The difficulty
   tokens (`--easy`, `--medium`, `--hard`) are deliberately left alone, so
   blue/gold/red mean the same thing all year round.

2. **`themes.js`** — draw the season's marks into the `MARK` library, then add
   an entry to the `THEMES` table:

   ```js
   MARK.mask = '<path ' + SOLID + ' d="…"/>';   // inner markup, 24×24 viewBox

   {
     id: 'carnival',
     label: 'Carnival',
     blurb: 'Confetti and masks.',
     windows: [['02-01', '02-06']],  // inclusive, "MM-DD"; wraps past New Year
     emblem: MARK.mask,              // the crest and the picker's icon
     fall: [MARK.mask, MARK.confetti]   // tiled into the background wash
   }
   ```

   Marks are inner markup for a **24×24 viewBox**, and they inherit their
   colour, so use `currentColor` — the `LINE` and `SOLID` constants at the top
   of the file carry the shared stroke weight and fill. A mark is drawn as
   small as 20px, so keep the silhouette bold: fine serrations and interior
   detail turn to mush at that size. Reuse a mark from another season freely.

3. **For a scene** (optional — a season without one still gets its palette,
   backdrop and marks): add the `--scene`, `--scene-sky`, `--scene-ink*`,
   `--scene-accent` and `--horizon-*` tokens to its block in `themes.css`, and
   a drawing function to the `SCENES` table in `scenes.js`. The function gets
   the header's width and height, the half-width of the logo's column to keep
   clear, a horizon height, a size unit and a seeded random source; `ridge()`,
   `swell()` and `mark()` do most of the work.

The theme gallery, the picker and the masthead all read from those tables, so
they pick the new season up on their own.

### Checking your work

There is nothing to build — open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder
with `python3 -m http.server`. To see a season out of season, use the theme
button, or a URL: `themes.html?theme=halloween`. To check what the calendar
would choose on a given day, from the browser console:

```js
VCLThemes.forDate(new Date('2026-10-31'))  // "halloween"
VCLThemes.set('christmas')                  // switch, and remember it
VCLThemes.set('auto')                       // go back to following the date
```

### What a theme does and does not touch

A theme re-tints the shared palette, so the Case List follows it wholesale. The
Ultimate Archive and the Resource Library keep their own page identities — the
Archive's celeste, the Library's brown and gold are set per page in
`styles.css` — so on those two pages the season shows in the background wash,
the ornaments and the picker rather than in the panel colours. That is
intentional: the three windows are meant to stay tellable apart.

### What sets each season apart

The palettes keep every panel on readable paper. The seasons part company
behind it, in two places:

**The masthead is a scene.** Each season paints the header as a sky, puts a
light right behind the logo, and draws a horizon along the bottom:

| Season | Sky | Behind the logo | Horizon |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New Year | midnight, starfield | gold glow | fireworks over a lit skyline |
| Valentine's | rose | pale blush | heart garlands, a lace edge |
| Easter | spring blue | soft sun | clouds, tulips and painted eggs on the hills |
| Summer | sea-sky to peach | sun haze | gulls, a sail, three swells of surf |
| Autumn | amber sunset | warm haze | a line of turning trees on the hill |
| Halloween | bruised purple | **the full moon** | a bare tree, a leaning graveyard, bats |
| Christmas | winter night | lamplight | snowy pines and a lit cabin |

The horizon is drawn by `scenes.js` at the header's real pixel size, not scaled
from a fixed canvas, and redrawn whenever that size changes. It steps aside for
the logo's column, and the ridges calm down towards the middle so the credits
and crest always sit on open sky. Each season's shapes are seeded, so the scene
is the same on every visit.

The light and the moon are anchored to where the logo actually is (`--logo-w`
and `--logo-cy` in `themes.css`), not to a percentage of the header: on a phone
the header is shorter, and a percentage slid the moon down behind the credits.

**The page has a backdrop.** Behind the panels, each season has a colour and a
weave of its own: a starfield for New Year, tufted satin quilting for
Valentine's, painted-egg stripes and polka dots for Easter, seigaiha waves for
Summer, a woollen flannel plaid for Autumn, a spider's web in the corner of the
night for Halloween, a gift-wrap lattice dusted with snow for Christmas. A
sparse tile of the season's marks is washed over it.

**Nothing moves.** An earlier version had marks falling down the page; they
were taken out, so the themes are entirely still.

Nothing is read straight off the backdrop: every panel sits on paper, and the
Archive and Library footers, which used to be transparent, get a paper band
when a scene is on. The Archive and Library heroes keep their own identity and
get no scene.

Every mark is SVG drawn on the same 24×24 grid at the same stroke weight. No
emoji: they render differently on every platform, can't take the palette's
colour, and never match the site's line work.

### Accessibility

The wash and the scene are decorative only: both are hidden from assistive
technology and neither takes pointer events.

## Files you'll edit as a list maintainer

Almost all updates only touch two files:

- **`cases.json`** — add/remove/edit cases. Schema below.
- **`site_info.json`** — sets the "Last updated" and "Scheduled update" dates shown in the Docket panel. Open the file in any text editor and change the date strings.

The "What's new" list in the Docket panel is **auto-derived from cases.json**: cases with the most recent `approval_date` show up there automatically. You don't need to maintain it separately.

## Resource Library & Ultimate Archive

The site has two additional full-screen windows alongside the Case List, opened from the
**Case List / Resource Library / Ultimate Archive** nav bar at the top of the page (or the
matching buttons in the resource strip below it):

- **Vanilla Resource Library** (`data/resource-library.json`) — guides, tools, and community
  links for casing on Vanilla.
- **Vanilla Ultimate Archive** (`data/ultimate-archive.json`) — the historical index of every
  case ever created.

Both pages are built from the same folder-tab boxes the Case List uses, stacked down the page,
each one tinted to its own page's palette (celeste on the Archive, brown/gold on the Library):

- **About** (Archive) — the page's `description` from its JSON, in its own box.
- **Contents** (Library) — one compact card per section with its live entry count and blurb.
  Click one to filter the results below.
- **Filters** — the same panel as the Case List's: search, section/year chips, a Sort dropdown
  (Listed order, A–Z, Z–A — no difficulty, length or NSFW controls, which are case-list-only)
  and Reset, with the live count along the bottom.
- The results grid itself, in its own panel.

Picking a section drops its blurb in above the results, as a shelf label with an ornament of its
own per section. Every control rides along in the URL (`?cat=`, `?q=`, `?sort=`) so a filtered
view can be linked or bookmarked.

Each window is completely independent: its own search box, its own category filter, its own
scroll position, and its own `#resources` / `#archive` URL hash. Opening one never shows the
other, and closing either one returns you to exactly where you were on the Case List. Escape,
the × button, and the "Back to Case List" button all close the current window.

### Adding or editing entries

Both files share the same shape:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "tagline": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "sourceDocUrl": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/…",
  "importNote": "Optional banner shown at the top of the window.",
  "categories": ["Category A", "Category B"],
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "title": "Entry title",
      "category": "Category A",
      "description": "One or two sentences.",
      "url": "https://…",
      "source": "google-doc | external | internal",
      "type": "guide | tool | link | reference | download",
      "tags": ["keyword", "keyword"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Add a new object to `entries` and, if it introduces a new category, add that category name to
the `categories` array so it shows up as a filter chip. No code changes are needed — both
windows render straight from these two files, the same way the Case List renders from
`cases.json`.

### Why these files don't fully mirror the source Google Docs yet

Both windows link back to their source Google Doc (via `sourceDocUrl` and the **View Source
Document** button), which remains the authoritative, most current copy. The JSON files ship
with a starter set of entries built from links and references that already existed elsewhere
in this project (the Discord, the tier list, the submission form, the "How Do I Make a Case?"
guide, etc.), rather than the full contents of the Docs themselves.

That's because a Google Doc's body text isn't available to a static site (or to an automated
tool reading the page) without a signed-in, JavaScript-rendered browser session — there's no
public export endpoint for a Doc that isn't explicitly published to the web, and scraping the
authenticated editor UI would be exactly the kind of fragile client-side scraper this project
intentionally avoids. If you want the windows to show more of a Doc's contents:

1. Open the source Doc yourself.
2. For each section/link/guide you want listed, add an `entries` object following the schema
   above (category, title, description, url, type, tags).
3. Save the file — no rebuild step needed, it's picked up on next page load.

## Features

- **118 cases** with titles, creators, descriptions, difficulty, length, tags, approval dates, and links — extracted directly from the source PDFs.
- **Manilla folder card design.** Every panel has a folder-tab on top: difficulty tabs (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD) for cases, plus RANDOM, THE DOCKET, FILTERS, and FAQ tabs for the larger panels.
- **The Docket panel** shows last-updated date, scheduled next update, current case count, and an auto-derived "What's new" list of cases from the most recent update.
- **Featured Case** in the Random panel — automatically displays the most recently approved case as a clickable preview.
- **Grid / List view toggle** — switch between the 3-column card grid (default) or a single-column row layout that resembles the original VCL doc. Your preference is remembered between visits.
- **Search** by title, creator, or description.
- **Filter** by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), length (Short/Moderate/Long), and tags (NEW, Tutorial, Custom Files). Tag filters stack — pick multiple. The **NEW** and **Custom Files** tags are detected automatically (see *Automatic tags* below), so the filters always reflect reality.
- **NSFW filter** — a "Hide NSFW cases" toggle in the filter row. Off by default; flip on to hide explicit cases. The random picker respects this toggle.
- **Sort** by Difficulty Order (default), Length Order, Alphabetical (A–Z or Z–A), or Most Recently Added (uses real approval dates from the update history).
- **Random Case picker** with optional difficulty restriction. Roll Again button included.
- **Custom Files = clickable downloads.** When a case has a `custom_files_url` set, a green "Custom Files" pill appears automatically and links straight to the Drive folder for that case's assets. No tag needed.
- **Resources nav strip** — Vanilla Ultimate Archive, Resource Library, Casing Hub Discord, Tier List, Submit form, FAQ.
- **Built-in FAQ section** (toggleable) — all Q&As from the original doc.
- **Per-page link previews.** Each page carries its own Open Graph card, so a pasted link shows that page's own logo, title and accent bar: navy + VCL logo for the Case List, cyan + the Ultimate Archive logo, brown + the VRL logo. See *Step 6* in `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for the one prefix to change if the site moves.
- **Mobile-responsive** down to phones.
- **No build step, no dependencies.** Pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## Hosting

Because the site loads `cases.json` via `fetch()`, **it must be served from a web server.** Opening `index.html` directly with a double-click (`file://`) will look broken. This is a browser security restriction.

Three easy hosting options:

1. **Drop into your existing site.** Upload the whole folder somewhere on your server (e.g. `https://yoursite.com/vcl/`) and visit the URL. Done.
2. **Local testing.** From this folder, run `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open <http://localhost:8000>.
3. **Static host** like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or Vercel — just drag the folder in.

If somebody opens the site via `file://` by accident, they'll see a clear in-page error explaining what went wrong.

## Adding a case

Open `cases.json` and append a new object to the **end** of the array. Example:

```json
{
  "id": 119,
  "title": "Turnabout Awesome",
  "creator": "Your Name",
  "description": "A short blurb that appears on the card. Keep it under ~250 characters.",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "length": "Moderate",
  "tags": [],
  "url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/.../edit",
  "custom_files_url": "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/.../",
  "approval_date": "2026-06-01",
  "image": "images/cases/case_119.jpg",
  "logo_credit": "Artist Name"
}
```

> **You no longer add `"NEW"` or `"CUSTOM FILES"` to `tags` by hand** — see *Automatic tags* below. In the example above, the case gets the **Custom Files** pill automatically because `custom_files_url` is filled in, and the **NEW** badge automatically because its `approval_date` is the latest one. Leave `tags` empty unless the case is `"NSFW"` or a `"Tutorial Case"`.

### Field reference

| Field              | Type     | Allowed values                                                     |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | number   | Any unique integer. It's a permanent name tag, **not** a position — give each new case the next highest unused number and never renumber or reuse one. Gaps left by deleted cases are fine. |
| `title`            | string   | Display name                                                       |
| `creator`          | string   | Author handle(s)                                                   |
| `description`      | string   | Short summary                                                      |
| `difficulty`       | string   | `"easy"`, `"medium"`, or `"hard"`                                  |
| `length`           | string   | `"Short"`, `"Moderate"`, or `"Long"` (or `null`)                   |
| `tags`             | array    | Manual tags only: `"Tutorial Case"` and/or `"NSFW"`. **Do not add `"NEW"` or `"CUSTOM FILES"`** — those are automatic (see *Automatic tags*). Use `[]` for most cases. |
| `url`              | string   | Link to the case document (use `null` if not yet available)        |
| `custom_files_url` | string   | (Optional) Direct download URL for case-specific assets. **Setting this automatically shows the green "Custom Files" pill** — no tag required. Leave it out or `null` if there are none. |
| `approval_date`    | string   | ISO date when added to VCL (e.g. `"2026-05-01"`). Drives card ordering, the "Most Recently Added" sort, the Docket "What's new" list, and the automatic **NEW** badge (every case sharing the most recent date is marked NEW). |
| `image`            | string   | Path to the logo image, e.g. `"images/cases/case_119.jpg"`         |
| `logo_credit`      | string   | (Optional) Who made the case logo. Shown as "Logo by …" beneath the logo in the case popup. Omit it or use `null`/`""` if there's no credit to show. |

### Automatic tags

Two of the tags maintain themselves — you never type them into `cases.json`:

- **⭐ NEW** is given to every case whose `approval_date` matches the most recent `approval_date` in the whole file. When you add the next batch (all sharing a newer date), they become NEW and the previous batch stops being NEW — automatically. Nothing to remove by hand.
- **Custom Files** appears whenever a case has a `custom_files_url`. Fill that field in and the linked green pill shows up; leave it blank and it doesn't.

Both also drive their filter chips, so the NEW and Custom Files filters always match what's on the cards. (Any old `"NEW"`/`"CUSTOM FILES"` entries still sitting in `tags` are simply ignored, so nothing breaks — but you can delete them whenever you like.)


Then drop the logo image into `images/cases/` using a matching filename. Recommended size: ~300×170 px, JPG or PNG. The grid scales it to fit automatically.

## Removing a case

Delete its object in `cases.json`. The card will disappear on the next page load. You can also delete the matching image file from `images/cases/` to keep the folder tidy.

## Editing the Docket panel (last updated / scheduled update)

Open `site_info.json`. It has just three fields you'll typically touch:

```json
{
  "scheduled_update": "2026-06-01",
  "scheduled_update_label": "1st June 2026"
}
```

- **`scheduled_update`** is the ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the next planned update. Used for sorting/internal logic.
- **`scheduled_update_label`** is what the user sees ("1st June 2026"). If you'd rather just write something like "Coming soon" or "TBA", you can — it's just text.

The "Last updated" date is computed automatically from the most recent `approval_date` in `cases.json`. If you want to override that for some reason, set `last_updated_override` and `last_updated_label_override` in `site_info.json` (see the comments in the file).

The "What's new" list is computed automatically from cases whose `approval_date` matches the latest update date. If you ever want to curate that list manually, set `whats_new_override` to an array of case IDs (e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`).

## Editing a case

Edit the fields directly in `cases.json` and reload. No build step.

## Customizing the look

All visual tweaks live in `styles.css`. The colour palette is in `:root` at the top — edit the `--easy`, `--medium`, `--hard`, `--cream`, `--ink` etc. variables to retheme.

The folder-tab look uses `clip-path` for the slanted edge — modify the polygon coords to change the tab silhouette.

## Monthly update workflow

When the next update rolls around (e.g. "1st June 2026"), do this:

1. **For each new case**, append an entry to the end of `cases.json` with the next unused `id`, all the case fields, and `"approval_date": "2026-06-01"` (matching that update's date). Leave `tags` empty (`[]`) unless it's NSFW or a tutorial — the **NEW** badge and the **Custom Files** pill are added automatically from `approval_date` and `custom_files_url`.
2. **Drop the new case logo** into `images/cases/` named to match (e.g. `case_119.jpg`).
3. **Open `site_info.json`** and change the `scheduled_update` and `scheduled_update_label` to the date AFTER this one (e.g. "1st July 2026").
4. **Save and refresh.** The "Last updated" date in the Docket panel will auto-update to "1st June 2026", the case count will increment, the new cases will sort to the top of their difficulty bands, the "What's new" list will list them, and they'll get the ⭐ NEW badge while the previous batch loses it — all automatically. No further edits required.

If you're using GitHub to host the site, see `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for the editing workflow through GitHub's web interface (no command-line tools needed).

— Built for the Vanilla Casing Hub. Happy casing!
